GraphQL

GraphQL is query language. It still uses HTTP requests under the hood, we have a nice query language sitting on top of that.   It solves the problems:
1. Overfetching
2. Underfetching

It has single endpoint.
 GraphQL query looks like  query ReviewQuerys {
	reviews {
		rating,
		author {
			name
		}
	}
}

Mutation is used for modifying data.
