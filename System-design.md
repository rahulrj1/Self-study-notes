System Design

CAP theorem in Distributed System: Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance

Some C++ Concepts:
- Const member function of a class like int func() const {} A const member function guarantees not to modify the state of the object. It can only call other const member functions. It can only modify mutable member variables but can read all member variables. 

SOLID Principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have single reason to change
2. Open-Closed Principle: open to extension but closed to modification (interface and pure virtual function in cpp are used for this)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle: base class could be substituted by derived class
4. Interface Segregation Principle: avoid stuffing too much in a single interface
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: high level shouldn’t depend upon low level stuffs. Both should depend upon abstraction. Abstractions shouldn’t depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstraction.

A/c to gamma categorisation, there are 3 categories of patterns:
1. Creational Pattern: 
    1.  Builder Pattern: It is used to construct a complex object step-by-step
2. Structural Pattern
3. Behavioral Pattern
